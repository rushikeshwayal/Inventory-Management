# Inventory Management System for Municipal Corporations

## Overview

Efficient inventory management is vital for municipal corporations to ensure the availability of essential resources, minimize waste, and optimize costs. This project aims to address the challenges posed by outdated or manual inventory management systems by providing a modern, automated solution.

## Problem Statement

Municipal corporations often rely on manual and outdated inventory management systems, leading to resource shortages, excess stock, increased costs, and reduced operational efficiency. Manual tracking introduces errors and delays, resulting in inaccurate records and mismanaged supplies.

## Project Description

Our proposed Inventory Management System will enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of inventory management in municipal corporations. By automating key processes and leveraging advanced technologies, the system will lead to better resource allocation, reduced costs, and improved service delivery.

## Objectives

1. **Automate Shelf-Life Management**: Automatically track and manage the shelf life of perishable items to ensure timely usage and reduce waste. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system will determine shelf life based on various factors.

2. **Enhance Internal Communication**: Implement an internal communication system to facilitate seamless interaction between different departments regarding inventory needs and updates.

3. **Manage Inventory Workflow**: Establish a workflow management system to oversee the movement and status of inventory items, ensuring that processes are followed systematically.

4. **Implement Authorization Controls**: Create an authorization system that defines who can move inventory items from one status to another, enhancing security and accountability.

5. **Provide Notifications**: Develop a notification system to alert relevant personnel about critical inventory events, such as low stock levels, expired items, or pending approvals. Alerts will be generated for products nearing expiration within 8 days or reaching minimum criteria.

6. **Maintain an Asset Database**: Maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date database of all assets, supplies, and equipment, providing a single source of truth for inventory management.

7. **QR Code Generation and Tracking**: Generate a QR code for each product entry when purchased by government bodies. The QR code will keep track of all transactions and updates related to the product within departments, providing a complete history.

8. **Alert System**: Implement an alert system to notify personnel about products with low shelf life and items that require replenishment (e.g., when the quantity drops below a minimum threshold).

9. **Audit Solutions**: Provide different audit solutions for regular audits to ensure inventory accuracy and compliance.

10. **Invoice Generation**: Automatically generate invoices for each transaction, ensuring proper documentation and accountability.

## Features

- **NLP for Shelf Life Determination**: Utilize NLP algorithms to automatically assess the shelf life of products based on product type, storage conditions, and other relevant factors.

- **Internal Messaging System**: A built-in messaging platform that allows departments to communicate inventory needs and updates efficiently.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define user roles and permissions to control who can access and modify inventory data.

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Immediate alerts for low stock, expired items, and critical inventory events delivered through email and SMS.

- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on inventory status, historical data, and trends to assist in decision-making. Reports include transaction history with timestamps.

- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate the growing needs of municipal corporations as their inventory requirements expand.

## Usage

1. **Product Entry**: Enter new products into the system, which will generate a unique QR code for tracking.

2. **Track Inventory**: Use the QR code to monitor transactions and updates for each product, maintaining a complete history within departments.

3. **Receive Alerts**: Get notified about critical inventory events, such as low stock levels, items nearing expiration, and those reaching minimum criteria.

4. **View Reports**: Access comprehensive reports to analyze inventory status, trends, and transaction history with timestamps.

5. **Conduct Audits**: Utilize built-in audit solutions to ensure inventory accuracy and compliance.

6. **Generate Invoices**: Automatically generate invoices for each transaction to document inventory movement and changes.
